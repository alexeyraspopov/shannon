# Shannon

A JavaScript Library. Provides communication flow for your program systems.

Inspired by ["A Mathematical Theory of Communication"][1].

## Why?

Data management layer and view layer can be rewritten with new library, but communication flow will be the same.

## Ideas

 * Functional infrastructure
 * Unidirectional data flow
 * Declarative style

## Questions

 * What I'm trying to build?
 * What types of web pages will be supported by Shannon? (content pages, statefull apps)
 * How many instances can app has to stay simple? (2, 3)
 * How can we describe a protocol in communication system between app and user?
 * What about 3rd party libs for rendering and data persistance?
 * How can we manage a complex state of systems?
